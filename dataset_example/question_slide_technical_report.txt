4- In general, how much clearance is desired around a car when parking?
    (answer : The amount of clearance desired around a car can vary depending on the specific vehicle and parking situation. However, generally, a minimum of 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) of clearance is recommended for the front and rear of the car, and 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 meters) of clearance is recommended for the sides and corners.)
5- How does the measurement procedure alter the recommendation? 
    (Answer : The measurement procedure can alter the recommendation by providing data that informs the decision-making process. For example, if the measurement procedure shows that the mean value decreases with practice, it may recommend increasing the amount of practice to achieve better results. However, without specific information about the recommendation and the measurement procedure in question, a definitive answer cannot be given.)
6- How does the desired clearance vary with driver age and sex? 
    (Answer : The desired clearance can vary based on factors such as driver age and sex. For example, older drivers may require a greater clearance to avoid obstacles, while the desired clearance for female drivers may be different than for male drivers due to differences in body size and reach)
7- How can the desired clearance be predicted? 
    (Answer :The ANOVA procedure begins with the appropriate column of clearance values and determine a typical age for a user of the interface and adjust the value)
8- Is the size of the person exiting a vehicle related to the clearance desired for opening the door?
